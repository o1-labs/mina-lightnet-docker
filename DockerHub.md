# Lightweight Mina Network Docker Images

Spin up a lightweight Mina network within the single container.

These Docker images provide a simple and efficient way to deploy and run lightweight Mina blockchain networks for testing purposes. It is an implementation of the [Dockerization of Mina local networks](https://github.com/o1-labs/rfcs/blob/main/0004-dockerised-local-network.md) RFC.

Each Docker image is packaged with the genesis ledger configuration with more than 1000 prefunded accounts. Each account has a balance of 1550 MINA.

## Specifications

- This Docker image exposes port `8080` that is served by the NGINX reverse proxy with proper cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) management and passes requests to an available Mina Daemon GraphQL endpoint.
- To ensure that the **o1js** zkApps applications work without additional environment configuration, you must use an endpoint like `http://127.0.0.1:8080/graphql` to communicate with the Mina GraphQL endpoint.

By default, containers run the [Mina Archive Node](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/node-operators/archive-node) along with the PostgreSQL RDBMS that stores the blockchain data.

- To prevent the Mina Archive Node and RDBMS from running in the container, set the `RUN_ARCHIVE_NODE` environment variable to `false`.

  ```shell
  docker run ... --env RUN_ARCHIVE_NODE="false" ...
  ```

Connection to the container's PostgreSQL can be used for other needs, including the [Archive-Node-API](https://github.com/o1-labs/Archive-Node-API).

- The default PostgreSQL connection string is:

  ```shell
  postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/archive
  ```

If no Mina Archive Node will run inside the container, then [Archive-Node-API](https://github.com/o1-labs/Archive-Node-API) won't be available.

## Mina accounts manager

The Mina accounts manager helper tool, provided with the Docker images, automates how users retrieve account information.  
An example use case this application is parallel automated tests execution against the lightweight Mina network.

- Since executed in parallel, these tests should be isolated so they do not impact the work and environment of each other.
- This tool provides a way for humans and programs to get "unused" (not in use by anyone else) accounts at any particular point in time.

To keep the accounts pool available for other tasks, be sure to release used accounts after you've done with your work.

## Usage

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

Before the Mina network can be used in your job or jobs steps, it must reach the synchronized state after the corresponding [service container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers) startup. You can use the [wait-for-mina-network](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/wait-for-mina-network) GitHub Action to automate this process.

### Single Node

```shell
docker run --rm --pull=always -it \
  --env NETWORK_TYPE="single-node" \
  --env PROOF_LEVEL="none" \
  --env LOG_LEVEL="Info" \
  -p 3085:3085 \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 8181:8181 \
  -p 8282:8282 \
  o1labs/mina-local-network:compatible-latest-lightnet
```

#### Single Node network properties

- Transaction finality (k) in 30 blocks
- 720 slots per epoch
- New blocks are produced every ~20-40 seconds
- 5-8 transactions per block
- ~850-970 MB of RAM consumption after initial spike and if stays alive during less than 2 hours ~= 1/2 epoch
- The startup and sync time is ~1-2 minutes

#### Single Node logs

By default, logs produced by different processes will be redirected into the files located by the following path pattern inside the container:

```shell
/root/logs/*.log
```

You can always use Docker Volumes to map the corresponding logs storage path inside the container to the host machine.

```shell
docker run ... --mount "type=bind,source=/tmp,dst=/root/logs" ...
```

It is especially useful if you want to keep the logs after the container is stopped and deleted. For example when used in CI/CD pipelines.

where:

- The `compatible` prefix corresponds to the Mina GitHub repository branch
- The `lightnet` suffix corresponds to the Dune profile that was used during the application build procedure for current image tag
